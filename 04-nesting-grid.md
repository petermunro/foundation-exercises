## Nesting the Grid

The grid can be nested.
Think of a table within a table cell.

- a two-column text layout within a standard 3-column layout
  containing a "main" cell
- a grid of buttons in a header or footer

1. Copy the file `exercise-files/03.html` into the directory `foundation-4-example`.

1. Edit the file to add a row of three cells into the middle element.

1. Check your work.
