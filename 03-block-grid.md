## The Block Grid

The block grid is a powerful and useful layout technique.
It sets elements up so they are evenly spaced across a row.
Examples:

- a list of 8 products
- a square grid of evenly spaced products (think eBay or Amazon)
- image galleries

1. Create an unordered list (`<ul>`),
   containing list items (each of which could contain an image, for example).
1. Add CSS classesin a similar way to before:

        <ul class="small-block-grid-3 large-block-grid-6">

    And that's it! Check your grid in your browser at different screen widths.
